// Exercise 8)
// Write a program that will allow someone to guess a four digit pin exactly 4
// times. If the user guesses the number correctly. It prints “That was
// correct!” Otherwise it will print “Sorry that was wrong.” Program stops after 
//the 4th attempt of if they got it right.
let pin = 0704;
console.log("Please make your guess");

for(let i = 1; i <= 4; i++){
 console.log(i);
